# Bucketsort

This implemenation sorts integer arrays with bucket sort in C. Tested for up to 2.000.000 elements and it comes with its own test suit implementation.

## Setup

`sudo apt-get install gcc python-pip`

`sudo pip install when-changed`


# Run and watch

comile and run:
`make default app=bucketsort_test`

auto re-compile and re-run on file change:
`make watch app=bucketsort_test`

`app=` has its default value set to bucketsort_test, therefore you could easily skip this parameter.
